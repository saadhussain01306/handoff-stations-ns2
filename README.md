# Steps to run the File

# ns simulation.tcl

OR

# xgraph -x "Time (s)" -y "Hand-off count" -tk -P handoff_count.dat

This code simulates a hand-off management system in a wireless communication network. Its functionality includes:

1. **Minimum and Maximum Functions**: Two procedures `min` and `max` are defined to find the minimum and maximum of two numbers respectively. These functions will be used later in the code to ensure that users stay within the coverage area of base stations.

2. **Simulation Parameters**: Several simulation parameters are set, including the number of base stations (`num_bs`), the number of users (`num_users`), simulation time in seconds (`sim_time`), and the interval between user movements in seconds (`movement_interval`).

3. **Hand-off Count Initialization**: `handOPIoff_count` variable is initialized to keep track of the number of hand-offs that occur during the simulation.

4. **Base Station and User Initialization**:
   - Base stations (`bs`) are randomly positioned within the coverage area (0,100) using a loop.
   - Users (`user`) are also randomly positioned within the coverage area (0,100) and their initial base station indices (`user_cur_bs`) are set to -1.

5. **Output File Creation**: A file named "handoff_count.dat" is created to store the hand-off count over time.

6. **User Movement and Hand-off Management Simulation**:
   - A loop simulates user movement and hanOPId-off management over time (`sim_time`).
   - Inside the loop, user movement is simulated by updating their positions randomly within a small range using a nested loop.
   - Hand-off management based on the OPI-RLI-HO (Optimization Parameter Interpolation-Received Level Indicator-Handover) scheme is performed for each user:
     - The nearest base station to each user is found by calculating the Euclidean distance between the user's position and each base station's position.
     - If the nearest base station is different from the user's current base station (`user_cur_bs`), a hand-off is considered necessary. The `handoff_count` is incremented, and the current base station index for the user is updated.
   - The current hand-off count at each simulation time step is written to the output file.

7. **Output File Closure**: The output file is closed after the simulation loop.

8. **Printing Total Hand-offs**: The total number of hand-offs is printed to the console.


The xgraph plot generated by this code visualizes the hand-off count over time during the simulation.This includes:

- **X-Axis (Time)**: The x-axis represents time in seconds. It spans the duration of the simulation from the start time (0 seconds) to the end time (`sim_time`), which in this case is 1000 seconds.

- **Y-Axis (Hand-off Count)**: The y-axis represents the hand-off count. It shows the cumulative number of hand-offs that have occurred up to each point in time during the simulation. 

- **Data Points**: Each data point on the plot corresponds to a specific time during the simulation and shows the corresponding hand-off count at that time. These data points are generated at regular intervals determined by the `movement_interval`.

- **Trend**: The plot provides insights into the trend of hand-off occurrences over time. It helps to visualize how the hand-off count changes as users move within the network coverage area and potentially switch between base stations.

- **Interpretation**: A rising trend in the plot indicates an increasing number of hand-offs over time, suggesting higher mobility or congestion within the network. Conversely, a relatively flat trend may indicate stable user movement patterns with fewer hand-offs.

- **Insights**: By analyzing the plot, one can gain insights into the efficiency and performance of the hand-off management system. High peaks in the plot may indicate instances of frequent hand-offs, which could impact network stability and user experience. On the other hand, a steady or gradually increasing trend may indicate an effective hand-off management strategy.

In summary, the xgraph plot provides a visual representation of the hand-off count dynamics over the simulation period, enabling observation of trends and patterns in hand-off occurrences within the wireless communication network.

9. **Plotting Hand-off Count Over Time**: Finally, the `xgraph` command is used to plot the hand-off count over time with the generated data file "handoff_count.dat". The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the hand-off count.

In summary, this code simulates the movement of users in a wireless communication network and tracks the occurrence of hand-offs between base stations as users move around. It then outputs the total number of hand-offs and plots the hand-off count over time.

# Handover Management Models

This repository contains datasets and scripts related to the comparison of three handover management models:

1. Traditional Handover
2. Group Cell Handover (GCHO)
3. OPI-RLI-HO (Optimization Parameter Interpolation-Received Level Indicator-Handover)

## Introduction

In cellular networks, handover management is a crucial process that ensures seamless connectivity for mobile users as they move between different cells. Efficient handover algorithms are essential to maintain high-quality service and optimize network resources. This repository explores and compares three handover management models to evaluate their effectiveness in different network scenarios.

## Models Overview

### Traditional Handover

Traditional Handover is a conventional approach where handover decisions are based on predefined thresholds for parameters such as Received Signal Strength (RSS), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and Mobility Speed. These static thresholds are set by network operators and may not adapt well to dynamic changes in network conditions, leading to suboptimal handover performance.

## parameters used in the `generate_traditional_handover_dataset` procedure:

1. **num_samples**: This parameter determines the number of samples or data points to be generated for the dataset. It specifies how many sets of data points will be created.

2. **rss (Received Signal Strength)**: This parameter represents the strength of the signal received by a mobile device or receiver. It's generated randomly within the range of -120 dBm to 0 dBm. A higher RSS typically indicates better signal quality.

3. **snr (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: This parameter represents the ratio of the signal power to the noise power in a communication channel. It's generated randomly between 0 dB and 30 dB. A higher SNR indicates better signal quality and less interference.

4. **cell_load**: This parameter represents the load or utilization of a cellular network cell. It's generated randomly between 0 and 100, indicating a percentage of the cell's capacity being used.

5. **coverage_area**: This parameter represents the coverage area of a cellular network cell. It's generated randomly between 1 and 10, possibly indicating the radius or extent of coverage in kilometers or any other unit of measurement.

6. **mobility_speed**: This parameter represents the speed of mobility of the mobile device or user within the network. It's generated randomly between 0 and 120, possibly indicating kilometers per hour or any other unit of measurement.

7. **handover_threshold**: This parameter represents the threshold for triggering a handover in a traditional handover scheme. It's generated randomly within the range of -90 dBm to -110 dBm. When the received signal strength falls below this threshold, a handover decision may be initiated to maintain connectivity.

These parameters together form a dataset reflecting various conditions and characteristics of a cellular network, including signal strength, noise, network load, coverage area, mobility speed, and handover thresholds. The dataset is then saved to a CSV file named "data_trad.csv" for further analysis or use.

### Group Cell Handover (GCHO)

Group Cell Handover (GCHO) introduces a novel concept where neighboring cells are grouped together, and handover decisions are made based on the collective performance of these groups. By considering clusters of cells rather than individual cell performance, GCHO aims to reduce signaling overhead and improve network efficiency, especially in dense urban environments with overlapping cells.

## parameters used in the `generate_gcho_dataset` procedure:

1. **num_samples**: This parameter determines the number of samples or data points to be generated for the dataset. It specifies how many sets of data points will be created.

2. **group_size**: This parameter represents the size of a group of cells involved in a Group Cell Handover (GCHO) scheme. It's generated as an integer value between 2 and 5. In a GCHO scheme, neighboring cells are grouped together to coordinate handover decisions collectively.

3. **interference_level**: This parameter represents the level of interference experienced in the network environment. It's generated randomly between 0 and 20, indicating the severity of interference from external sources or neighboring cells.

4. **group_load**: This parameter represents the load or utilization of the group of cells participating in the GCHO scheme. It's generated randomly between 0 and 500, possibly indicating the aggregate traffic or resource usage within the group.

5. **group_coverage_area**: This parameter represents the coverage area of the group of cells participating in the GCHO scheme. It's generated randomly between 2 and 20, possibly indicating the combined coverage radius or extent of the grouped cells.

These parameters together form a dataset reflecting various characteristics and conditions relevant to a Group Cell Handover (GCHO) scheme, including group size, interference level, group load, and group coverage area. The dataset is then saved to a CSV file named "data_group.csv" for further analysis or use.

### OPI-RLI-HO

OPI-RLI-HO (Optimization Parameter Interpolation-Received Level Indicator-Handover) is an advanced handover management method that leverages Optimization Parameter Interpolation (OPI) and Received Level Indicator (RLI) to dynamically adjust handover decisions based on real-time network conditions. By interpolating optimization parameters and considering received signal levels, OPI-RLI-HO aims to optimize handover decisions for improved network performance and user experience.

# parameters used in the `generate_opi_rli_ho_dataset` procedure:

1. **num_samples**: This parameter determines the number of samples or data points to be generated for the dataset. It specifies how many sets of data points will be created.

2. **optimization_parameter**: This parameter represents a value indicating the optimization parameter for a system or process. In the context of this dataset generation, it's randomly generated between 0 and 1. It could signify any variable that needs optimization within a system, such as throughput, efficiency, or resource allocation.

3. **received_level_indicator**: This parameter simulates a received signal strength or any other indicator relevant to the system under consideration. It's generated randomly between 0 and 100. In real-world scenarios, it could represent a metric like signal strength, signal-to-noise ratio, or any other performance indicator.

4. **handover_decision**: This parameter represents a binary decision, either 0 or 1, indicating whether a handover should be performed. It's determined based on the value of the received level indicator. If the received level indicator is greater than 50, a handover decision of 1 (indicating "yes") is made; otherwise, it's 0 (indicating "no"). In telecommunications or network systems, handover decisions are crucial for maintaining connectivity and quality of service.

These parameters together form a dataset reflecting various conditions or states of a system, along with decisions made based on those conditions. The dataset is then saved to a CSV file named "data_opi.csv" for further analysis or use.

# Comparison of Handover Methods in Cellular Networks

This repository contains a comparative analysis of three handover methods commonly used in cellular networks: Traditional Handover (TH), Group Cell Handover (GCHO), and Optimization Parameter Interpolation-Received Level Indicator-Handover (OPI-RLI-HO).

## Overview

Handover is a critical process in cellular networks where mobile devices switch from one base station (cell) to another to maintain connectivity as users move within the network. Different handover methods employ various parameters and decision-making algorithms to optimize handover decisions.

This README provides an overview of the key parameters considered in each handover method and highlights how OPI-RLI-HO stands out for its dynamic and adaptive approach.

## Parameters Considered

### 1. Received Signal Strength (RSS):
- **Traditional Handover (TH):** RSS is a fundamental parameter in traditional handover mechanisms. It represents the strength of the signal received by the mobile device from the serving base station. Handover decisions are often made based on predefined RSS thresholds. When the RSS falls below a certain threshold, indicating weakening signal strength, a handover to a stronger signal cell is triggered.
- **GCHO:** In Group Cell Handover, RSS from multiple neighboring cells might be considered collectively. Instead of relying solely on the RSS of the serving cell, a decision is made based on the combined RSS of a group of cells. This approach can lead to more informed handover decisions, especially in scenarios where multiple cells provide similar signal strengths.
- **OPI-RLI-HO:** While RSS is still a crucial parameter in OPI-RLI-HO, its importance might be dynamically adjusted based on the optimization parameter. This method might weigh RSS differently depending on factors such as network congestion, interference, or user mobility. By adapting the importance of RSS dynamically, OPI-RLI-HO can optimize handover decisions more effectively.

### 2. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):
- **Traditional Handover (TH):** SNR measures the ratio of the desired signal power to the background noise power. In traditional handover methods, SNR might be used as a supplementary metric alongside RSS. It becomes particularly important in environments with high noise levels, where maintaining a good SNR is essential for communication quality.
- **GCHO:** Similar to traditional methods, GCHO might consider SNR to assess the quality of signals from multiple neighboring cells. It helps in determining the best cell or group of cells to hand over to, especially in scenarios where interference and noise are significant factors.
- **OPI-RLI-HO:** SNR could be integrated into the optimization process of OPI-RLI-HO. Depending on the optimization parameter and network conditions, OPI-RLI-HO might prioritize handovers based on SNR when it's critical for maintaining communication quality.

### 3. Cell Load:
- **Traditional Handover (TH):** Cell load refers to the amount of traffic or activity handled by a cell at any given time. In traditional handover methods, overloaded cells might trigger handovers to less congested cells to balance the load and prevent performance degradation.
- **GCHO:** Group Cell Handover methods might take into account the load of multiple cells within a group. Instead of focusing solely on the load of the serving cell, GCHO considers the collective load of all cells in the group before making handover decisions.
- **OPI-RLI-HO:** Cell load is one of the parameters that OPI-RLI-HO might dynamically adjust based on the optimization parameter. By considering the current load distribution across cells and optimizing handover thresholds accordingly, OPI-RLI-HO aims to improve overall network performance and resource utilization.

### 4. Coverage Area:
- **Traditional Handover (TH):** Coverage area indirectly influences handover decisions in traditional methods. While not directly considered, maintaining seamless coverage across cells is crucial for ensuring uninterrupted communication for mobile users.
- **GCHO:** Group Cell Handover methods might explicitly consider coverage area, especially in scenarios where it's necessary to ensure consistent coverage across multiple cells within a group. Handover decisions aim to optimize coverage overlap and minimize coverage gaps.
- **OPI-RLI-HO:** OPI-RLI-HO could incorporate coverage area into its optimization process to ensure efficient coverage management. By dynamically adjusting handover parameters based on coverage area considerations, OPI-RLI-HO aims to enhance overall network coverage and performance.

### 5. Mobility Speed:
- **Traditional Handover (TH):** Mobility speed influences handover decisions in traditional methods, especially for fast-moving users. Higher mobility speeds might trigger more frequent handovers to maintain continuous connectivity.
- **GCHO:** Group Cell Handover methods might consider mobility speed when coordinating handovers between cells within a group. Faster-moving users might require more proactive handover strategies to ensure seamless connectivity.
- **OPI-RLI-HO:** OPI-RLI-HO dynamically adjusts handover parameters based on mobility speed to optimize handover decisions for users moving at different speeds. By considering mobility characteristics, OPI-RLI-HO aims to provide smoother handover experiences and minimize disruptions for mobile users.

### 6. Handover Threshold:
- **Traditional Handover (TH):** Traditional handover methods typically rely on fixed handover thresholds based on predefined criteria such as RSS or SNR. These thresholds determine when a handover should be initiated.
- **GCHO:** Group Cell Handover methods might dynamically adjust handover thresholds based on group characteristics and network conditions. Instead of using fixed thresholds, GCHO adapts thresholds to optimize group handover decisions.
- **OPI-RLI-HO:** OPI-RLI-HO dynamically optimizes handover thresholds based on real-time network conditions and the optimization parameter. By adjusting thresholds dynamically, OPI-RLI-HO aims to improve handover efficiency and adaptability to changing network conditions.
